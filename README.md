# GraduationProject-Software
This is my Graduation Project built using React native and node js.
The app includes a customer side and a driver side, allowing customers to place new orders, track their status in real-time, including live package tracking, and message drivers directly within the app. Drivers can receive requests from nearby areas, accept or reject them, and update the delivery status and use the provided map for navigation to the customers and recipient locations. 
and here is a demo for the final result: https://youtu.be/uai3KNowMPY
